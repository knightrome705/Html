   <h1>printer</h1>
   <p>In computing, a printer is a peripheral machine which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text, usually on paper.[1] While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers.[2] Different types of printers include 3D printers, inkjet printers, laser printers, and thermal printers.[3]</p>
