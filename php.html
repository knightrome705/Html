    <h1>PHP</h1>
    <p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”. 

        Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. 
        
        PHP code is executed in the server.
        It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Informix.
        It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.
        It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.
        Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.
        One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.
        The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.
        The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.
        Other characteristics of PHP are as follows.
        
        Simple and fast
        Efficient
        Secured
        Flexible
        Cross-platform, it works with major operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
        Open Source
        Powerful Library Support
        Database Connectivity</p>
